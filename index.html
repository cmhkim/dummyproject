<h2>Social Studies: Week 12</h2>
<h3>Day: 2<br>Paragraph: The End of The California Mission System</h3>
<p class="info">When misuderstandings happened, the Native Americans sometimes rebelled<br>against the padres. 
In 1775, around 800 Kumayaay attacked the mission at San Diego and burned<br>
it to the ground. In 1785, the San Gabriel mission was attaced.<br><br>
The struggle finally ended when the Mexicans gained their freedom from Spain in 1821.<br>
One of the first things the Mexicans did was to break up the missions. The padres were allowed to keep the churches, <br>
but the farmland and pueblos were given to the settlers. <br>
Some of the land was supposed to be given to the Native Americans, but this didn't do them much good, <br>
as their way of life was changed forever. Instead of living as hunters and gatherers, as they had done in the past, <br>
they had now come to live as more of a European lifestyle. Also now that much of the land <br>
belonged to other people, they were no longer free to hunt and gather wherever they pleased. <br>
Many of the Native Americans who lived in the missions took jobs working on farms belonging to the new settlers. <br>
California's economy, or way of life, now depends on agriculture, or farming, and would for many years to come.</p>

<h2>Social Studies Week: 12</h2>
<h3>Day: 4 Why were the missions shut down?</h3>
<p>One reason the mission system began to break down is that many of the Native Americans, <br>
who were coerced into living, working, and being converted in to missions, died off <br>
because of disease brought by the Spanish padres. Those Native Americans who were left often<br>
disliked mission life and tried to run away. By the time Mexico broke away from <br>
Spain and took control of California, the missions were already losing their importance. <br>
When Mexico didn't have enough money to pay its soldiers, it sometimes gave them mission lands<br>
instead of wages. Mission land was also given to Mexican citizens in return for favors to the government. <br>
By 1934, the Mexican government ruled that all the California missions be shut down.</p>
