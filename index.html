<h1>Dummy Program!!!!!!! How exciting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
<p>When misuderstandings happened, the Native Americans sometimes rebelled<br>against the padres. 
In 1775, around 800 Kumayaay attacked the mission at San Diego and burned<br>
it to the ground. In 1785, the San Gabriel mission was attaced.<br><br>
The struggle finally ended when the Mexicans gained their freedom from Spain in 1821.<br>
One of the first things the Mexicans did was to break up the missions. The padres were allowed to keep the churches, <br>
but the farmland and pueblos were given to the settlers. <br>
Some of the land was supposed to be given to the Native Americans, but this didn't do them much good, <br>
as their way of life was changed forever. </p>
